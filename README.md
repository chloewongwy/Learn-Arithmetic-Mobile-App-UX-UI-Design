# Learn Arithmetic – Mobile App UX/UI Design  

This project is a **UX/UI design prototype** for a mobile learning application called **LearnMath**.  
The app was designed for **children, parents, and teachers** to support arithmetic learning through **gamification, interactive tasks, and progress tracking**.  

## 📅 Project Info  
- Developed: November 2023  
- Note: This project was completed without the use of AI tools.


## 📖 Project Overview  
The goal of this project was to design a mobile app that makes learning arithmetic fun and engaging for children while also providing **parents and teachers with tools to track and support learning progress**. The design follows **HCI principles and Shneiderman’s 8 Golden Rules** to ensure usability, accessibility, and a positive user experience.

## 🎨 Key Features  
### 👦 Children  
- Interactive **math games** (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).  
- **Gamification** with rewards, badges, and leaderboards.  
- **Multiplication tables** for revision.  
- Progress tracking and instant feedback.  
- Timed challenges for improving speed and accuracy.  

### 👨‍👩‍👧 Parents  
- View child’s tasks and performance reports.  
- See detailed answers chosen by their children.  
- Flashcard mode for joint learning with children.  
- Notifications when tasks are completed.  
- Chatbox to communicate with teachers.  

### 👩‍🏫 Teachers  
- Assign arithmetic tasks (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).  
- Track submissions, scores, and task progress.  
- Class analysis and question analysis reports.  
- Task creation tools with redo/undo.  
- Chatbox to communicate with parents.  

## 🛠️ Non-Functional Highlights  
- **Cross-platform**: Supports iOS & Android, optimized for both phones and tablets.  
- **Offline mode**: Multiplication tables and games accessible without internet.  
- **Accessibility**: Font size adjustment, language options, and music controls.  
- **Performance**: Lightweight (<500MB), fast response (<5s).  
- **Security**: Password-protected accounts, daily backups of progress.  


## 🧪 Testing  
Structured interviews were conducted with primary school children to evaluate:  
- **Engagement** (colors, game structure).  
- **Ease of use** (sign-up, navigation, icons).  
- **Learning effectiveness** (feedback in games, multiplication tables).  
- **Motivation** (ranking system, badges).  

## 📖 Design Principles Applied  
- **Shneiderman’s 8 Golden Rules**: Consistency, error prevention, user control, informative feedback.  
- **Gamification**: Rewards, levels, challenges, and leaderboards.  
- **Recognition over recall**: Intuitive icons (house for home, trophy for ranking, etc.).  
- **Responsive feedback**: Color-coded answers, hover states, hints in division.
